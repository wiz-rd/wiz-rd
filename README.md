🍃 I'm interested in:
- Privacy
- Software development
- Linux
- Learning skills
- AI _(ethically)_
  - Other types of Machine Learning
- Technology
- And...

_Upending the status quo - not relying solely on tools, languages, or software created before us when more efficient or better possibilities exist that only have yet to be found or implemented._

🍀 I like:
- Linux
- FOSS
- Clean code
- Fun projects
- Good Documentation
- Growth

_I like absurd words. Such as..._

Eclectic

_Broad, open, and diverse. Haphazard and hodgepodge; originating from a wide variety of different sources and places._

And that's all!
