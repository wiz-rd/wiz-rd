Hello, I’m [@wiz-rd](https://github.com/wiz-rd/)
-

_A pedantic computer peruser who knows enough to know I don't know much._

🌿 I'm comfortable with:
- Python
- Windows
- [API integration/JSON](https://github.com/wiz-rd/Canvas-Desktop-Reminders)

🌱 I'm vaguely familier with:
- Java
- JavaScript
- Linux
- CLIs
- GitHub

🍃 I'm interested in:
- Privacy
- Software development
- Linux
- Learning skills
- AI _(ethically)_
- Technology
- And...

_Upending the status quo - not relying solely on tools, languages, or software created before us when more efficient or better possibilities exist that only have yet to be found or implemented._

🍀 I like:
- Linux
- FOSS
- Clean code
- Fun projects
- Documentation
- Growth

🌵 I dislike:
- JavaScript _(why are semicolons optional??)_
- Sitting still for too long
- Not challenging myself

📫 How to reach me:
_No idea. I think there's an email around here somewhere._

⚡ Fun fact:
_I like absurd words. Such as..._

Eclectic
-

_Broad, open, and diverse. Haphazard and hodgepodge; originating from a wide variety of different sources and places._

And that's all!
-

_Do not conform. And by doing so, conform. Captive to our illusions of individuality._
