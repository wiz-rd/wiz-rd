Hello, I’m [@wiz-rd](https://github.com/wiz-rd/)
-

_A pedantic computer peruser who knows enough to know there's still much to learn._

🌿 I'm comfortable with:
- Python
- Windows
- APIs - see [my cross-platform reminder script that notifies you of upcoming assignments using Canvas' API](https://github.com/wiz-rd/Canvas-Desktop-Reminders) and [a game I'm recreating that has its own API](https://github.com/wiz-rd/Rummikub)

🌱 I'm familier with:
- JavaScript
- Linux
- CLIs (both batch and bash)
- GitHub
- Java

🍃 I'm interested in:
- Privacy
- Software development
- Linux
- Learning skills
- AI _(ethically)_
  - Other types of Machine Learning
- Technology
- And, where wise, not relying on the status quo

🍀 I like:
- Linux
- FOSS
- Clean code
- Fun projects
- Good documentation
- Mechanical keyboards
- Growth

🌵 I dislike:
- Sitting still for too long
- Not challenging myself

📫 **How to reach me:**
No idea. I think there's an email around here somewhere.

⚡ **Fun fact:**
I like absurd words. Such as...

And that's all!
