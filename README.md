Hello, I’m @wiz-rd
-

_A pedantic computer peruser who knows enough to know I don't know much._

🌱 I'm vaguely familier with:
- Java
- JavaScript

🌿 I'm comfortable with:
- Python

🍀 I like:
- Linux
- FOSS
- UIs
- Clean code
- Fun projects
- Documentation
- Collaboration
- Learning
- New tech stuff
- Growth

🌵 I dislike:
- JavaScript _(why are semicolons optional??)_
- Sitting still for too long
- Not challenging myself

📫 How to reach me:
_No idea. I think there's an email around here somewhere._

⚡ Fun fact:
_I like absurd words._
